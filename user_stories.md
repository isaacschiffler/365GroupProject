# User Stories and Exceptions

## User Stories
1. As an environmentalist, I want to buy used goods so that I can employ sustainable equipment purchasing practices.
2. As someone who is new to backpacking, I want to be able to rent a light tent since I do not already own one so that I do not have to purchase a tent that I might not use more than once.
3. As an avid backpacker that likes to update my equipment, I want to be able to offer my old equipment up for sale so that it doesn't collect dust in my storage.
4. As someone looking for a used sleeping bag, I want to be able to see the condition of items I'm looking at so I buy something that isn't too overused.
