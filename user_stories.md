# User Stories and Exceptions

## User Stories
1. As an environmentalist, I want to buy used goods so that I can employ sustainable equipment purchasing practices.
2. As someone who is new to backpacking, I want to be able to rent a light tent since I do not already own one so that I do not have to purchase a tent that I might not use more than once.
3. As an avid backpacker that likes to update my equipment, I want to be able to offer my old equipment up for sale so that it doesn't collect dust in my storage.
4. As someone looking for a used sleeping bag, I want to be able to see the condition of items I'm looking at so I buy something that isn't too overused.

7. As a full-time mountaineer, I want to be able to trade in worn-down equipment for better, newer ones for a lower price than simply buying the new equipment alone.
8. As the parent of four young children, I want to be able to return out-grown equipment and have basic renting options available.
9. As someone who prefers hotels and does not like the outdoors, I want to be able to purchase higher-end tents and am willing to spend more for this luxury.
